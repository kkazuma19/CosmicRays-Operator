# This directory (data) is a location which contains all datasets used in this research.

## neutron_data_22_yrs.npy
- The neutron sensor data (2001-2023). The dataset contains the daily neutron counts (count/s) over 23 years between 2001-01-01 and 2023-12-31.
- The tag '22' in the filename is a typo, so please ignore.

## dose_array.npy
- The solution data corresponding to the neutron sensor data. 
- It was prepared with EXPACS (developed by Japan Atomic Energy Agency) and the spatial resolution was set to 1 deg in lat and lon. 

## DoseNumpy025
- High spatial resolution solution datasets prepared with 0.25 spatial resolutions in lat and lon.
- This dataset was used for the study of zero-shot capability.

## add_sensor
- The additional neutron sensor data for the robustness check for adding new sensor.
- The duration is the same as the neutron_data_22_yrs.npy, but new sensor location (MXCO).
